Ok, if you want to pull out the js and css and piece it, that'll work fine. If you want a very low level boilerplate for working on stuff like this from your desktop the rest is pretty easy.

ok, So first you'll need to install [nodejs&npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) and get the ability to access your terminal.

Then you'll have to run `npm install` to get the gulp / sass / browser sync installed. After you get those installed, run the command `gulp` and it will boot up your browser for you.

This may seem like a bunch a rigamarole, but once you get it setup you can just write and browser will update it as it goes. 

Js animation might seem a bit more approachable since it's actually a programming language that you dispatch events from.

Css will seem very odd because it's not really a programming language. it's a set of properties you feed a browser and you just hope for the best.
